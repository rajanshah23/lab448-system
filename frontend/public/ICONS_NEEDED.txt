PWA Icon Requirements
=====================

The PWA manifest requires two icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These should be PNG format images with your app logo/icon.

For now, you can:
- Use any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG files with your logo
- Or use an online tool to generate PWA icons from a single image
- Recommended: Use a simple wrench/repair tool icon with "Lab448" text

Place these files in the /frontend/public/ directory.
